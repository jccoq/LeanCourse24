% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
In this document we aim to share our experience with this project, including the first problems we encountered,
such as choosing the project topic, main results we have formalized alongside with the difficulties we have had to
overcome. We finish with some conclusions and a short reflection. We will mainly follow \cite{COB22}.

\section{Choosing our project topic}
There were various options that seemed good for us, from Carmichael numbers
to orientability of manifolds. Lastly, we decided to work in a complex analysis topic:
the winding number.

The winding number of a curve can be defined in several ways, although we only
focused on the topological and analytic ones. Our main goal was going to be
to prove the equivalence between these definitions, albeit we quickly noticed
it was going to be a very stretch goal due to its complexity and the time we had.

Since this project focuses on the definition and properties of the winding number,
we will now give the definition of \textit{curve} that we have used - there is no a general
consensus on how to define them, especially regarding the definition interval.

For us, a curve $\gamma$ will be a $\cal{C}^1 (\text{I}, \mathbb{C})$ function, where I stands for the unit interval.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Topological definition:} it uses the path-lifting property [ref]. Given
  a curve $\gamma : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{C}$ and $z_0 \in C$ satisfying $z \notin \text{im} \gamma$, the winding
  number of $\gamma$ around $z_0$ is defined as
  $$\omega (\gamma, z_0) = s(1) - s(0),$$
  where $(\rho, s)$ is the path written in polar coordinates, this is, the lifted path
  through the covering map
  $$p : \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$$
  $$(\rho_0, s_0) \mapsto z_0 + \rho_0 e^{i2\pi s_0}.$$
  \item \textbf{Analytic definition:} The analytic definition is more straightforward. Consider the curve $\gamma$
  and the point $z_0$ as previously specified. The winding of $\gamma$ around $z_0$ is defined as
  $$\omega(\gamma, z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{0}^{1} {\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)-z_0} \text{dt}}.$$
\end{itemize}

After spending half a week discussing wether we should try proving the equivalence of definitions we
noticed that there was a big problem regarding this issue: there are a lot of results missing in Mathlib
--- especially from algebraic topology --- which we would had need just to get to define the winding number.

\section{Main formalized results}

\noindent \textbf{Remark:} the sign of the winding number depends on the orientation we choose for going along
the curve or, in other words, if the curve winds \textit{clockwise} or \textit{counterclockwise} around the point.
For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen the counterclockwise orientation as the default one. In the case a curve is given
in the opposite orientation, we can always perform a change of basis to get back to desired scenario.

The main results we have formalized are the following:
\begin{theorem}
    Given a curve $\gamma$ and a point $z_0$ satisfying (P), then
    $$\omega(\gamma, z_0) \in \mathbb{Z}.$$
    In other words, the winding number of a curve around a point is always an integer.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  Given a curve $\gamma$ with winding number $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the winding number of the reverse curve,
  say $\tilde{\gamma}$, is precisely $-n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The winding number $\omega(\gamma, z)$, seen as a function of $z$, is continuous in $\mathbb{C}\setminus \imm \gamma$.
\end{theorem}
\section{Main difficulties and solutions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Coming up with the most suitable definition for curves. The very first thing we had to tackle, far from a lemma or theorem, was giving the right - this is, the
  most accurate one - definition of a curve. First we opted for defining it for an arbitrary interval $(a, b)$
  but we rapidly noticed this was unnecesary and the vast majority of the literature simply used the unit interval,
  so we decided to change to that.
  \item But that was not the unique thing we had to change about the structure definition of a (closed) curve. At the beginning, we opted
  for putting the continuity and differentiability conditions separately but, after hearing the given advices, we noticed
  the best option was to put them together using the \verb|ContDiffOn| condition from Mathlib library.
  \item As a complementary definition we thought about adding the concatenation of curves, i.e.,
  piecewise curves, as we explained in the presentation. However, as Floris noticed, the definition was not
  accurate, since we had to add conditions of differentiability in the "glueing" points of the curves. For this
  reason, we have decided to remove this concept from our work. Nonetheless, it would be a great (maybe future work,
  outside the lecture) to formalize this concept properly and prove the same theorems for them, then providing a
  more general treatment of the winding number for piecewise curves.
  \item Proving continuity of the index function. Mathlib misses results missing continuity of parametric
  integrals (which is a fundamental concept in mathematics, namely in analysis and PDEs) so we had to do it the classical
  way - using the $\varepsilon - \delta$ definition of continuity. It is usually tedious to work with this concept
  on paper, thus doing it in LEAN4 has been, sometimes, a big trouble.
  \item As an extra point, we would like to add how the harsh treatment some analytic expressions require. Further analysis and
  comment on this can be found in the conclusions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and possible future work}
As we discussed in the presentation, one of the main conclusions that arise from this project is that
Mathlib desperately needs contributions - there exist several gaps regarding important results and concepts.
Besides this, refining the treatment and work with integrals would be appreciated. For instance, a recurrent problem
we have faced is the following: let $I_1, I_2$ be two definite integrals. LEAN4 doesn't interpret these expressions as the same:
$$I_1 - I_2 = (I_1) - I_2.$$
Sometimes, the RHS of the equation was directly obtained from obtaining a lemma that doesn't involve any parentheses.
